# Graph-Creator
Tkinter and Turtle Graph Creator

Feel free to use this software to graph data.
It can draw a line of best fit that is either straight, following a power law or exponential.
You can use colours and a key.

If you would like to run it as an executable file, run \dist\Graph Creator\Graph Creator.exe.

I could add more to this, like a scroll bar, more lines etc. but this is just a small project.
The code is messy but commented, as it started off as a linear regression algorithm then became a line of best fit drawer before I finally decided to make it into a proper project.

Please, comment on any bugs.
